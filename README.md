I use UnitOfWork and Repository design patterns for this project.
The application contains 2 API endpoint which in future will be used 
by other application(s) with UI. 
"api/candidate/create" - this endpoint for creating candidate, if already exist this email update it. 
"api/candidates/get-all" - this endpoint for getting all candidates according to filter parameters. 
This project was built in 4 days and it takes time about 10 hours. 

I did not have time to implement fully the caching, logging, and test parts due to the close of the given deadline.
